# MLOps Project Documentation

This document provides an in-depth explanation of each file and folder in the MLOps project. It answers:
- **Why do I need this file?**
- **How does it support the code?**
- **Non-coder explanation with examples**

---

## **Folder and File Structure**

### **1. `README.md`**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It provides an overview of the project, including what it does, how it’s structured, and how to use it.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It doesn’t directly affect the code but is critical for new developers, collaborators, or users to understand the project.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Think of this as an instruction manual. Without it, someone picking up the project would have no idea what it’s about or how to get started.

---

### **2. `requirements.txt`**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It lists all the Python libraries (dependencies) required to run the project.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It ensures that the correct versions of the libraries are installed, which is crucial for reproducibility.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Imagine building furniture—you need specific tools and materials. This file is the list of those tools. Without it, you might try to use the wrong tool (library version) and fail to build correctly.

---

### **3. `.gitignore`**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It tells Git which files or directories to ignore when tracking changes in the project.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It prevents unnecessary or sensitive files (like large datasets or temporary files) from being committed to version control.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Imagine you’re organizing a photo album. `.gitignore` is like a note saying, “Don’t include blurry or duplicate photos.” Without it, your album (repository) might get cluttered with useless files.

---

### **4. `dvc.yaml`**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It defines a data versioning pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control) to manage datasets and models.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It helps track changes in datasets and ensures that the correct versions are used during model training.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Think of it as a recipe. It ensures that every time you bake a cake (train a model), you use the same ingredients (data). Without it, you might accidentally use stale or incorrect ingredients.

---

### **5. `data/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need these files?**
  - They contain the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning model.
- **How do they support the code?**
  - Without data, the model cannot learn or make predictions.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Data is like fuel for a car. Without it, the car (model) won’t move. If the fuel is bad or missing, the car won’t function properly.

---

### **6. `notebooks/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need these files?**
  - They contain Jupyter notebooks used for exploring the data and running experiments.
- **How do they support the code?**
  - These notebooks help data scientists understand the data better and test different models before formalizing the code in Python scripts.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Think of it as a sketch before building something. Without it, you might waste time building something that doesn’t work.

---

### **7. `src/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need these files?**
  - These are the core scripts of the project:
    - **`data_preparation.py`**: Prepares the data for training.
    - **`train.py`**: Trains the machine learning model.
    - **`evaluate.py`**: Evaluates the model’s performance.
    - **`serve_model.py`**: Serves the model as an API for real-time predictions.
- **How do they support the code?**
  - Without these files, you cannot build, train, evaluate, or deploy the machine learning model.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Imagine building a robot. These files are like different parts of the assembly process—preparing the parts, assembling them, testing the robot, and finally putting it to work.

---

### **8. `docker/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need these files?**
  - They help containerize the application so that it runs consistently across different environments.
- **How do they support the code?**
  - Without them, running the project on another computer might lead to errors because of differences in configurations.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Think of Docker as a lunchbox—you pack everything you need (code, libraries) so you can eat (run the project) anywhere without worrying about missing ingredients.

---

### **9. `deployment/kubernetes/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need these files?**
  - They contain Kubernetes manifests for deploying the model on a cloud platform.
- **How do they support the code?**
  - They automate the deployment process, ensuring that the model runs reliably in a scalable environment.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - It’s like instructions for assembling a tent. Without it, setting up the tent (deploying the model) would be much harder and error-prone.

---

### **10. `config/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It contains configuration settings, such as hyperparameters for the model.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It allows you to change settings without modifying the core code.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Think of it as a thermostat. Instead of rebuilding your heating system, you can just adjust the temperature. Without it, changing the behavior of the model would be harder.

---

### **11. `tests/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It contains unit tests to ensure that the code behaves correctly.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It helps catch bugs early by automatically testing different parts of the code.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Imagine you’re assembling a product. These tests are like quality checks to ensure nothing is broken. Without them, you might deliver a faulty product.

---

### **12. `.github/workflows/` (Folder)**
- **Why do I need this file?**
  - It defines a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate tasks like testing and deploying the model.
- **How does it support the code?**
  - It ensures that every change to the code is automatically tested and, if successful, deployed.
- **Non-coder explanation**:
  - Think of it as an assembly line in a factory. Without it, every task would need to be done manually, increasing the chance of errors.
